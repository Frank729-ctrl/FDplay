 MyWebRTCApp

MyWebRTCApp is a real-time communication app that utilizes WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) for peer-to-peer video and audio streaming. The app allows users to connect and communicate via video calls, providing an interactive and efficient communication platform.

Features

•	Real-Time Video and Audio Communication: Seamlessly stream video and audio between peers.
•	Peer-to-Peer Connection: Establish direct connections between devices without the need for a server to relay the media.
•	Easy-to-Use Interface: Clean and simple interface for initiating and receiving calls.
•	Cross-Platform Support: The app works across different devices that support WebRTC.
Technologies Used
•	WebRTC: A free, open-source technology that enables peer-to-peer communication, including video and voice calls, without the need for plugins.
•	Kotlin: The app is developed using Kotlin, a modern programming language for Android development.
•	Jetpack Compose: A modern toolkit for building native UI in Android.
•	Firebase: For backend functionality like real-time database and authentication.
